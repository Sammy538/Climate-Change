         <p><strong>What is climate change?</strong></p>
         <p><ul>
         <li>Climate change is the change of our weather over time.</li>
         <li>Change in global climates</li>
         </ul></p>
         <p><strong>Why is a problem and what are its effects?</strong></p>
         <p><ul>
         <li> Many human activities such as emissions of greenhouse gases and burning of fossil fuels have harmed our environment in many different ways.</li>
         <li>For example, glaciers are melting away at a faster rate now and the earthâ€™s temperature are increasing.</li>
         <li>More droughts will increase in different areas of the world</li>
         <li>There will be more natural disasters over the next decades</li>
         <li>Sea levels will rise and is expected to rise 1-4 feet by 2100</li>
         <li>Increase and more intense heat waves</li>
         <li>Glaciers have shrunk, ice on rivers and lakes is breaking up earlier and trees are flowering sooner</li>
         </ul></p>
         <p> Some solutions to climate change are to stop using non-renewable energies like fossil fuels and coal and to start using renewable energies like solar energy,hydropower, etc</p>
         <p> One way YOU can help is to spread the word about the negative effects that climate change and non-renewable energies have on our planet and to donate in order to help with funds for more renewable energies</p>
